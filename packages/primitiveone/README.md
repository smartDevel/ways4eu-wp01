# Primitive One Frontity Theme
A Headless WordPress (REST API) Theme for Frontity

![screenshot](img/punky.png)

Created with a little Node.js and React magic. 

Built on the awesome new, itty bitty, Frontity framework: https://frontity.org/ 

With little help from our friends: Bootstrap 4, GSAP and ScrollMagic. 

Live demo site: https://primitivedigital.co.uk  

GitHub: https://github.com/primitiveshaun/primitiveone

NPM: https://www.npmjs.com/package/primitiveone

Domain and WordPress hosting from: https://primitivehosting.uk/headlesswp

N.B. This is only my second attempt at React based website so do be kind.  
It may be messy and it may be downright wrong in places.	

See [changelog](CHANGELOG.md) for release notes.


## Issues, Fix and Refine ###

1. Query strings break routing / 404s
2. Having issues importing the bootstrap CSS correctly


## WIP: SEO bits and bobs ###

1) Zeit Now deployment 

Now recommends setting domains to point at their nameservers.
Or, alternatively setting CNAME/ANAME DNS records

- CNAME works for subdomains (www.) but you can not set CNAME records on the root i.e. example.com
- Not all domain registrars support ANAME records.
- My current deployment is set to use Zeit Nameservers
- You can set DNS records via the Now cli
- https://zeit.co/blog/now-dns / https://zeit.co/docs/v2/advanced/domains/dns/


Duplicated Content

- Do add canonical links to your index
- Self referncing canonical links are OK
<link rel="canonical" href="https://example.com/" />

robots.txt

- You can create a robots text via now.json (routes)
- You DO NOT need to do this manually for Frontity

www/non-www redirects

- Also possible via now.json (routes)
- To Do: https://zeit.co/guides/redirect-from-www/
